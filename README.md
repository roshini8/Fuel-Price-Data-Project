# Fuel-Price-Data-Project

Fuel Price Analysis (Malaysia) â€” Data Engineer Assessment
This project extracts, transforms, and analyzes Malaysiaâ€™s official weekly fuel price data to derive meaningful insights using Python and visualization tools.

ðŸ“Š Objective
To demonstrate data engineering skills by:

Extracting real-time fuel price data via an API.

Preprocessing and transforming the dataset.

Analyzing price trends, rolling averages, and differences.

Identifying meaningful insights for data-driven decisions.

ðŸš€ Tech Stack
Languages: Python 3.10+

Libraries:

pandas, numpy â€“ Data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn â€“ Data visualization

requests â€“ API interaction

Data Source: Malaysia Fuel Price API

ðŸ“š Future Improvements
Deploy the analysis as an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI.

Add forecasting models using ARIMA/LSTM to predict fuel price changes.

Integrate external data such as crude oil prices, exchange rates, or inflation for deeper correlation analysis.
